# Chest Disease Detection Using CNN AI Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements an AI-based system for the detection of chest diseases such as pneumonia and tuberculosis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) applied to chest X-ray images. The system aims to provide a rapid, accurate, and automated diagnostic tool for healthcare professionals, improving disease detection accuracy and reducing misdiagnoses in clinical environments.

## Features

* **Automated Diagnosis**: Utilizes deep learning (CNNs) to detect chest diseases such as pneumonia and tuberculosis from chest X-ray images.
* **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides real-time diagnostic output, helping healthcare professionals make faster decisions.
* **Pre-trained Models**: Uses pre-trained CNN architectures such as VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 for feature extraction and classification.
* **Optimized for Resource-Constrained Environments**: The system is designed to work efficiently even in remote or under-resourced healthcare settings.

## Technologies Used

* **Deep Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and classification.
* **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121) to leverage large-scale datasets and improve model generalization.
* **Python**: The primary programming language used for the development of the system.
* **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib for building and training the model.
* **Data Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, and grayscale conversion.

## Dataset

* **Chest X-ray Images**: A large dataset of labeled chest X-ray images containing both normal and abnormal cases (e.g., pneumonia, tuberculosis).
* **Data Augmentation**: Used to increase the diversity of the dataset, improving model robustness.

## Model Architecture

* **Pre-processing**: X-ray images are resized, normalized, and optionally converted to grayscale or RGB.
* **Feature Extraction**: The images are passed through pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, ResNet50, or DenseNet121) for hierarchical feature extraction.
* **Classification**: A fully connected layer with a softmax activation function is used to classify the images as either normal or showing signs of disease.
* **Performance Metrics**: The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chest-disease-detection.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the dataset (if required) and place it in the designated folder.
4. Run the model:

   ```bash
   python detect_disease.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Upload a chest X-ray image via the user interface (if applicable) or provide the image path in the script.
2. The system will automatically preprocess the image, pass it through the CNN model, and return a diagnostic result (either "normal" or the detected disease).
3. The results are displayed with relevant details such as disease type, accuracy, and additional insights.

## Evaluation

* **Training Data**: The model is trained using a labeled dataset of chest X-ray images, and performance is evaluated on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
* **Model Comparison**: The CNN-based model outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest) in diagnostic accuracy.

## Challenges and Limitations

* **Data Quality**: The modelâ€™s performance depends heavily on the quality and diversity of the dataset.
* **Privacy Concerns**: Sensitive medical data requires proper handling to avoid privacy breaches.
* **Model Generalization**: Variations in imaging devices and patient demographics can affect the model's performance.

## Future Work

* **Improved Dataset**: Incorporate more diverse and larger datasets to enhance model accuracy.
* **Model Optimization**: Experiment with more advanced architectures or custom model modifications for better performance.
* **Integration with Clinical Workflows**: Work towards seamless integration of the system into clinical practices for real-time diagnosis.
